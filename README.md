# MSEdgeRedirect
A Tool to Redirect News, Search, Widgets, Weather, and More to Your Default Browser

This tool filters and passes the command line arguments of Microsoft Edge processes into your default browser instead of hooking into the `microsoft-edge:` handler, this should provide resiliency against future changes. Additionally, an Image File Execution Options mode is available to operate similarly to the Old EdgeDeflector. Additional modes are planned for future versions.

No Default App walkthrough or other steps, just set and forget.

> :warning: PLEASE NOTE: MSEdgeRedirect is still BETA. Changes are to be expected, and performance to be improved.

## FAQ

### MSEdgeRedirect isn't listed in the "How do you want to open this?" Menu?

Select the **Featured** Microsoft Edge. MSEdgeRedirect will still properly function.

### Will MSEdgeRedirect work with Edge uninstalled?

MSEdgeRedirect is compatible with [@AveYo](https://github.com/AveYo)'s [Edge Removal](https://github.com/AveYo/fox/blob/main/Edge_Removal.bat) as it retains a needed component. If Edge was removed using another method, reinstall Edge Stable, then run AveYo's tool. After AveYo's Edge Removal has been run, simply install MSEdgeRedirect and it will be detected automatically.

### It isn’t working for me?

Run `microsoft-edge:https://google.com` using the `Windows` + `R` keys. If that is not properly redirected, [file a bug report!](https://github.com/rcmaehl/MSEdgeRedirect/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)

### Will searches inside \<app name here\> still use Bing?

MSEdgeRedirect only redirects links that attempt to open in MS Edge. It will not affect results generated within other applications.

### Can you change Bing results to Google Results?

Yes, as of 0.5.0.0, you can select One of 8 available Search Engines, or set your own!
